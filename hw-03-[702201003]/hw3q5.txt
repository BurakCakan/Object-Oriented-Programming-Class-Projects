	1. Random access to the matrix elements: for the performance; array>vector>map
 	Since map uses a key for the value and vector uses pointer, array is the best for random access.

 	2. Accessing all elements in a row: for the performance; array>vector>map
 	Since map uses a key for the value and vector uses pointer, array is the best for accessing all elements.

 	3. array>map=vector

	5. In matrix-matrix product, array>vector=map ; because matrix with arrays means pointer of pointers but matrix with vectors means vector of vectors which makes the difference. There is no significant difference btw map and vector.

	4. In dot product, the same as 5th answer is valid for dot product.
